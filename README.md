# Queensland eCourt Indexer (QEI)
The [Queensland court website](http://apps.courts.qld.gov.au/esearching/) has some relatively unhelpful indexing of files which both limits the utility of the search tool, and significantly increases the time/effort required for users to access files.

I'm building this tool to gather meta data from the eCourt website & create my own indexing, searching, and filtering.

An additional (and very useful) feature from the final product will be the ability to set email alerts on case updates. This is an imperative feature and currently not possible on the eCourt website.
